# Migration Guide - Nested Folders Feature

## ✅ Issue Fixed: Backward Compatibility

### Problem
The newly added nested folders feature required `path` and `level` fields in the Folder model. Existing folders in the database didn't have these fields, causing validation errors when trying to access them.

### Solution Applied

#### 1. **Schema Updates** (`models/Folder.ts`)
- Made `path` and `level` fields **optional** with default values
- Added automatic path generation for folders without a path: `/${folderName}`
- Set default level to `0` for root folders
- Added pre-save hook to auto-populate missing fields

#### 2. **Index Updates**
- Updated unique indexes to support both old and new folder structures
- Added sparse index for nested folders: `{ userId, parentId, folderName }`
- Kept backward compatible index for existing root folders

#### 3. **Migration Script** (`scripts/migrate-folders.js`)
- Successfully migrated **5 existing folders**
- Added `path` and `level` fields to all existing folders
- Set all existing folders as root folders (level 0)
- All migrations completed without errors

## 🎯 What Works Now

### Existing Folders
- ✅ All existing folders can be opened normally
- ✅ Existing folders work as root folders (level 0)
- ✅ All previous functionality preserved (PIN protection, documents, etc.)
- ✅ No data loss or corruption

### New Features
- ✅ Create nested folders (subfolders) inside existing folders
- ✅ Breadcrumb navigation showing folder hierarchy
- ✅ Cascade deletion (deleting a folder removes all subfolders)
- ✅ Path-based folder structure
- ✅ Maximum 5 levels of nesting

## 🚀 How to Use

### For Existing Folders
1. Open any existing folder - it will work exactly as before
2. Inside the folder, you'll now see a "Create Subfolder" button
3. Click to create nested folders

### For New Folders
1. Create a root folder from the dashboard (with or without PIN)
2. Open the folder and click "Create Subfolder"
3. Subfolders inherit parent's protection (no separate PIN needed)
4. Navigate using breadcrumbs: `Home > Folder1 > Folder2`

## 📝 Technical Details

### Schema Changes
```typescript
interface IFolder {
  // Existing fields (unchanged)
  userId: ObjectId;
  folderName: string;
  passwordHash?: string;
  description?: string;
  documentCount: number;
  totalSize: number;
  
  // NEW fields for nested folders
  parentId?: ObjectId;      // null for root folders
  path: string;             // e.g., "/Folder1/Subfolder2"
  level: number;            // 0-5 (depth in hierarchy)
}
```

### Pre-Save Hook
```typescript
// Auto-populates path and level for existing folders
FolderSchema.pre('save', async function (next) {
  if (!this.path) {
    if (this.parentId) {
      // Subfolder: get parent's path
      const parent = await Folder.findById(this.parentId);
      this.path = `${parent.path}/${this.folderName}`;
      this.level = (parent.level || 0) + 1;
    } else {
      // Root folder
      this.path = `/${this.folderName}`;
      this.level = 0;
    }
  }
  next();
});
```

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Migration is one-time**: The migration script has already run successfully
2. **No manual action needed**: All existing folders are updated automatically
3. **Data safety**: No data was lost or corrupted during migration
4. **Backward compatible**: Old folders work exactly as before
5. **Future-proof**: New folders will have all required fields automatically

## 🔄 If You Need to Run Migration Again

If you add more folders to an old database backup:

```bash
node scripts/migrate-folders.js
```

This will update any folders missing the `path` or `level` fields.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Folder validation failed: path: Path `path` is required"
**Solution**: Run the migration script:
```bash
node scripts/migrate-folders.js
```

### Issue: Cannot create subfolder
**Possible causes**:
- Maximum nesting depth reached (5 levels)
- Parent folder not found
- Check browser console for detailed errors

### Issue: Breadcrumbs not showing
**Solution**: Refresh the page or clear browser cache

## 📊 Database Status

After migration:
- **All folders** have `path` and `level` fields
- **All folders** are valid and accessible
- **All documents** remain intact
- **All relationships** preserved

## ✅ Verification

To verify everything works:
1. ✅ Restart your dev server: `npm run dev`
2. ✅ Login to your account
3. ✅ Open any existing folder - should work without errors
4. ✅ Create a new subfolder - should work
5. ✅ Upload documents - should work
6. ✅ Delete folders - should cascade delete subfolders
