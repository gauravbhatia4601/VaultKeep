### 3. Validation & Security

#### **Folder Validation Schema**
```typescript
createFolderSchema = {
  folderName: string (1-100 chars, trimmed)
  password: string (6-128 chars)
  confirmPassword: string (must match)
  description: string (optional, max 500 chars)
}
```

**Location**: `lib/validation.ts`

#### **Security Features**
- ✅ Password hashing with bcrypt (12 rounds)
- ✅ Rate limiting on folder password verification
- ✅ JWT-based folder access tokens (1 hour expiry)
- ✅ Ownership verification on all folder operations
- ✅ Cascade deletion for folders and documents
- ✅ Input sanitization and validation
- ✅ Password hash excluded from all API responses

---

### 4. Database Integration

#### **Folder Model Updates**
- Pre-save hook for password hashing
- Password comparison method
- Compound index (userId + folderName) for uniqueness
- toJSON transformation to exclude password hash

**Location**: `models/Folder.ts`

---

### 5. Middleware Updates

#### **Auth Middleware Enhancement**
Updated `requireAuth()` to return user data:
```typescript
requireAuth() => NextResponse | { userId, username, email }
```

This allows API routes to access user information directly.

**Location**: `middleware/auth.ts`
